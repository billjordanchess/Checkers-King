Checkers-King is a program that plays checkers. Note that checkers is also called draughts.

There is an ebook explaining the program. You can read of the first 10% of my book on Amazon.

Features include: 
move and capture generation, 
deepening iteration, 
alpha beta search, 
move ordering,
history moves,
material evaluation, 
position evaluation, 

The engine can play a human or itself.

It can both save and load positions for testing.

It is quite strong tactically and can search tactical lines deeply.

It is a work on progress.

Graphics are fairly basic and it uses keyboard input.
